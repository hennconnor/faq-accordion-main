## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

After working on several projects using libraries and frameworks such as React, Next.js and Tailwind.  I realized I was rusty on my origins.  This project was a return to my roots using strictly HTML, CSS and JS.  A fairly easy project that acted as a review but one that was much needed.

### Continued development

The completion of this project made me realize the importance of reviewing old concepts.  I plan to start another project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to further solidify my foundations.
